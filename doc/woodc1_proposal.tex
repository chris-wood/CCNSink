\section{Introduction}
At its core, the design and architecture of today's Internet is communication-based packet switching network. Since its inception, it has been retrofitted with a variety of transport and application layer protocols and middleware to support a growing set of consumer applications, such as the Web, email, and perhaps most importantly in recent times, media streaming services. The latter type of applications are bandwidth-intensive content distribution applications which leverage the underlying communication-based network as a distribution network, leading to a massive consumption of vital networking resources. 

Information-centric networks (ICNs) are a new class of network architecture designs that aim to address this increasingly popular type of network traffic by decoupling data from its source and shifting the emphasis of addressable content from hosts and interfaces to content \cite{first}. By directly addressing content instead of hosts, content dissemination and security can be ``distributed'' throughout the network in the sense that consumers requests for content are satisifed by \emph{any} resource in the network (i.e., not necessarily the original producer). For example, routers close to consumers may cache content with a particular name and then satisfy all content requests that match the content's name. In-network caching and data-centric security measures are two of the defining characteristics of these new network designs. 

As of today there are several information-centric networking proposals being explored as alternative designs to today's Internet; Named Data Networking (NDN) \cite{NDNtech} is one of the more promising designs that is still an active area of active research (see \url{www.named-data.net} for more information). As a replacement for IP-based networks, the complete adoption of NDN, or any one of these designs, will realistically need to be done by slow and continual integration and replacement of IP-based networking resources with NDN-based resources. Currently, however, there is no engineering plan to support the IP-to-ICN integration. 

Consequently, the primary objective of this project is to aid the integration of future content-centric networking resources into the existing IP-centric Internet by providing an application-layer gateway between IP and NDN resources. Application-layer traffic corresponding to protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, IMAP, etc. will be translated by middleware running in such gateways to correctly interface with the NDN resources, thereby serving as a semantic bridge between these two fundamentally different networking architectures. 

\section{Overview}
The NDN architecture enables relevant content to be pushed and stored throughout the network to minimize overall bandwidth consumption. Network caches and addressable content, rather than addressable hosts or interfaces, promote reduced network congestion and latency by keeping content closer to its intended recipients. The process by which content is requested is through the issuance of an \emph{interest} (a meaningful name for a piece of content). Routers that have cached content matching the interest name, or producers who advertise that they provide content matching the name, may respond with the corresponding (cryptogrpahically signed) piece of content. As a result, network flow is preserved since content traverses the same network path from which the interest originated. 

This content-based strategy for information retrieval is fundamentally distinct from IP-based content distribution. Therefore, in order to support the coexistence of IP and NDN traffic, the semantics of IP-based messages and NDN-based messages must be supported by some proxy. The proposed NDN gateway is intended to satisfy this role as a server and middleware software stack designed to support the translation between IP-based to NDN-based communication and messages. For example, HTTP GET requests would be intercepted and translated into an interest for the same piece of content. The procedure for such a translation consists of an IP-to-NDN resolution lookup (similar to a DNS query), message creation and transmission (e.g., HTTP GET to NDN interest), and response transformation (e.g., NDN content response to HTTP response). For application-layer protocols that maintain transport-layer state (e.g., persistent HTTP connections), TCP connection management will be automatically maintained at the gateway. This flow of messages is illustrated in Figure 1.

\section{Implementation Highlights and Milestones}
The implementation of this project will be done using both C/C++ and Java, and will rely on the open-source CCNx \cite{ccnx} library for all NDN-specific functionality. Architecturally, the middleware will be partitioned among a Java-based front-end for intercepting all IP-based traffic and performing application-layer protocol translation, a C-based backend utilizing the CCNx library to interface with NDN network resources, and, time-pending, a web interface that can be used to configure the gateway. Collectively, the deliverables for this project are a software design and architecture document, application gateway source code (Java and C/C++), and gateway configuration web interface. A preliminary timeline for the major milestones of this project is given below.
