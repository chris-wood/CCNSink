\section{Related Work}
Little work has been done to evolve existing TCP/IP applications to correctly operate in the presence of NDN resources. NDNPurple is the only published work dealing with this issue \cite{wang2010implementing}. This NDN-based middleware is designed to allow existing TCP/IP instant messaging applications based on the XMPP protocol, which is implemented on top of the libpurple library, to operate over an NDN network. To accomplish this task, NDNPurple re-implemented the networking layer of the libpurple library to interface with an NDN proxy that communicates with other proxies for other parties in a single ``chat room.'' The proxy is responsible for marshalling buddy-list update requests and overloaded message content interests to all communication proxies. Additionally, the proxy is responsible for intercepting XMPP control messages (e.g., session keep-alive message) issued from the libpurple library and responding with the appropriate response. This proxy-based design enables chatrooms to be created in an ad-hoc manner, i.e., without a centralized server that manages chatroom session information. 

Beyond this simple proof-of-concept IP-to-NDN application evolution, there has been no other published work dealing with IP/NDN interoperability (in the same spirit of this work).
