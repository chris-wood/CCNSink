\section{Performance Evaluation}

- test machine setup
- experimental procedures and applications
- link to source code
- message translation overhead both ways
- unidirectional and bidirectional RTT
- bridge latency
- say key generation and directory updates are asynchronous and one-time (don't happen a lot, so we didn't measure them)
